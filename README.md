# This project covers the basic functionality of the Urban Routes application, specifically for automating the process of ordering a taxi
# and waiting for a driver. Within this test suite, there were multiple test cases including ensuring that the user can set the addresses,
# select the supportive plan, fill in the phone number, add a credit card payment, write a message to the driver, order various items and
# icecream, and lastly wait for the driver. Some of the technologies used were the Mocha framework, headless mode to view the actions of the 
# browser, as well as devTools and css selectors to capture elements directly on the page. To run the tests, create a directory to store your
# copy of the project and clone using  git clone git@github.com:username/hm08-qa-us.git. Run the npm install command to add the needed 
# dependencies and replace the base URL with a newly generated server address. It is also a good idea to check your version of chromedriver to 
# ensure that it is compatible with the version in the package.json file.
